This tune attribution is set in a type face different from the surrounding text; one used for verses and historical notes later in the book. This attribution does not appear in earlier editions of *The Sacred Harp* or in *Union Harp or History of Songs*, suggesting it was a late discovery, prompting a modification to the page's electrotyped plate prior to printing.
