This romantic account of Chopin’s death became an ironic favorite *Original Sacred Harp* anecdote among newcomers to Sacred Harp singing who encountered the tunebook through choral or folk music during the second half of the twentieth-century. This sense of James’s historical notes as quaint and humorous sometimes felt condescending to longtime singers, and contributed to the decision of the book’s editors to remove James’s historical notes when revising the tunebook in 1991.
