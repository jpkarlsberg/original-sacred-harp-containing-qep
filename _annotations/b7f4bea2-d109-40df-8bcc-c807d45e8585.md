J. S. James copied the answers to his questions about the definition of musical sound, perception of tones, number of perceptible octaves, and significance of acoustics without attribution from a quite modern source, ""How to Listen to Music"" in Aubertine Woodward Moore's *For Every Music Lover: A Series of Practical Essays on Music* (1902). James interpolates his own questions with quotes from a section of Moore's essay that mirros James's own objective in this section on the ""law of sound.,"" discussing sound and musical sound in order to articulate the meaning of melody and harmony:

&gt; All sounds are the result of atmospheric vibrations affecting the ear. Musical sound, or tone, is produced by regular vibrations, and differs from mere noice whose vibrations are irregular and confused. The pitch of a musical tone rises in proportion with the rapidity of the vibrations that produce it. Tones may be perceived by the human ear ranging from about sixteen vibrations in a  second to nearly forty thousand, more than eleven octaves. Only about seven octaves are used in music. The science of acoustics is full of interesting facts of this kind, and is of profound value to any one who would gain an insight into the structure of music. (95)
