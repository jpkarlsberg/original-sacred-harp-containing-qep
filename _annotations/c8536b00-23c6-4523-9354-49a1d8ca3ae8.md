Despite “Tribulation”’s considerable stylistic remove from the music of nineteenth-century Polish composer Frédéric François Chopin, the similarity between Chopin’s surname and that of Trans-Appalachian Western singing-school teachers and composers Amzi and Lucius Chapin led J. S. James to misidentify Chopin as composer of this short song during his research into the authorship of Sacred Harp tunes. James’s desire to portray *Original Sacred Harp* as a high status object in connected to “great masters of music” and important figures in the history of Christianity may also have contributed to this misattribution, along with his status as a relative musical novice.
